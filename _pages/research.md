Research Interests
======
I enjoy working with data because I believe it has the ability to "speak" and provide answers to critical transportation questions. My goal is to leverage data to address transportation challenges. As a result, all of my research focuses on transportation and mobility data, including the collection, integration, and analysis of big data. To manage and make sense of this large-scale data, machine learning and data mining are essential, which is another key area of my research.

My current work spans the following areas:
- Segmented travel monitoring (visitors and commuters)
- Public transportation operation and management
- Traffic estimation
- Micromobilities
- Traffic signal control

## Research Demo
We've collected extensive data from Hawaii with the support of local agencies, covering most ground transportation modes, including private vehicles, public buses, rail, bikesharing, and hiking.

The following video showcases some example data.
