We have collected extensive transportation and mobility data in Hawaiʻi with the support of local agencies. The datasets cover most ground transportation modes, including:

- Private vehicles  
- Public buses  
- Rail transit  
- Bikesharing systems  
- Hiking and recreational trails  

These rich, multi-source datasets enable us to study travel behavior, system performance, safety, and sustainability across both daily commuting and visitor travel.
