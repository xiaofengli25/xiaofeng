My name is Xiaofeng Li, and I am currently an Assistant Professor of Transportation Management at the School of Travel Industry Management (TIM), The Shidler College of Business, University of Hawai'i at Mānoa (UH Mānoa). I joined UH Mānoa in 2023, after serving as a Research Assistant Professor at the University of Arizona.

Although my background is in transportation engineering, I chose to join the Business School at UH Mānoa to engage in interdisciplinary research, particularly in areas like commercial transportation and transportation marketing. My goal is to connect private transportation, public transportation, and commercial transportation into a cohesive transportation ecosystem to improve mobility, efficiency, safety, and sustainability. Hawai'i serves as a living research testbed for exploring these areas, providing a unique opportunity to refine traditional transportation management and operations. 

Another key reason for my move to Hawai'i is the rich food and culture. 

Research Interests
======
I enjoy working with data because I believe it has the ability to "speak" and provide answers to critical transportation questions. My goal is to leverage data to address transportation challenges. As a result, all of my research focuses on transportation and mobility data, including the collection, integration, and analysis of big data. To manage and make sense of this large-scale data, machine learning and data mining are essential, which is another key area of my research.

My current work spans the following areas:
- Segmented travel monitoring (visitors and commuters)
- Public transportation operation and management
- Traffic estimation
- Micromobilities
- Traffic signal control
